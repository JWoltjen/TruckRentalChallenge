# TruckRentalChallenge
Calculate the cost to rent a truck. The rental terms are
$25 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour.
Round up to the next hour after 10 minutes.
BONUS
Instead of $25 for the first hour, we are changing it to
be $5 for the first 20 minutes. Write your method in
such a way so that the logic does not have to change
if we adjust that rule again. Also, change the
calculation to round up to days:
$400/weekdayand$200/weekend day. A day is until
the end of business, not 24 hours.

I do this in an OOP awy and try to observe the single-responsibility principle.
